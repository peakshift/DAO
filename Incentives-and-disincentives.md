For the Peak Shift DAO

Example:

- a task is estimated to be 10 hrs
- you are being paid $10 an hour
- you deposit a sum of $100 to start said task



Outline

- If you complete the task within less than 10hrs, a bonus is given

		-  this can be seen as an incentive for persons to finish tasks quickly

- If, for eg, you go 2hrs over the estimate then \$20  is taken away and you only end up with $180

		-  you will get back the money you initially deposited

- However, if you are over the estimate by more than half of the estimated time, it would be best to reassign the task to someone else before you're further penalized and lose all of your deposit
